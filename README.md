* My portfolio site I designed simply.  Because this is the first HTML/CSS project I didn't want to add lot's of advanced features just for the sake of it.  I focused on the cookie cutter basics but tried to do them as well possible.  When designing the site I focused on spacing and fonts.

# 1. Demonstrate your understanding of your site's audience

I built my site around the target audience of potential employers.  To do this I tried to think about what potential employers would use the site for.  Primarily it would be to find contact information and also to get insights into my persona, skills and capabilities. All of my decisions in the design of the site were based around checking off these criteria.

-I included a contact form so that potential employers could get in contact with me easily.
-I made the site simple and effective implying that I am an elegant and effeciant programmer.
-I added a list of skills and my resume so that employers would be able to tell if I was suitable for the roll they were looking for.

# 2. Demonstrate the design decisions made

I decided that I wanted a simple website but with enough features and style to show that I was still competent at HTML and CSS.  I feel that a lot of beginner web designs will add features into their site even when not necessary just to show off their skills but destroying the cohesion and ellegance of the site in the process.  So my first decision was to stylistic go for a minimilist site.

The next design decision I faced was the order to place the content.  I decided to place the basic bio at the top of the page, then skills & further information lower in the page, and then finally the contact page.  I did this because potential employers would want a quick 30 second summery first to decide if I was worth contacting.  So prioritizing the order in which the user sees this was behind this decision.

One of the design decisions made was how to use the breaking points.  I designed the site for mobile first and then added features for tablet and desktop later.  With the majority of page views now on mobile I decided that it was best to prioritize mobile.  With the break points I moved some of the divs around and increased the font-size for bigger screens to allow good readibility.

Another design decision was whether to use a single page or multi-page site.  I decided that it would be better to go for a single page site because it kept in-line with my minimal style.  Just allowing the user to navigate with relative anchor tags.  There also wasn't a lot of content so having it all on the one page helped fill out the page.

# 3. Demonstrate that you considered usability heuristics

Some of the usability heuristics I used included.

	-1.When the user submits the contact form.  It takes them to another page so that they know their form has been submitted.  This is a visability of system status.
	-2.The site is simple without unnecessary features that might confuse the user.  It talks the language of the user and the information that they need is organized in a way that is intuitive, bio before contact form for example.
	-3.It uses black on white so easy for the user to read and people that might be colour blind will have no issue.
	-4.To make it easier for the use I included a navigation bar at the top of the page.  Even though the user could just scroll down to the section of the page that they wanted to access the navigation bar was still included incase the user didn't realize that he could scroll down.

# 4. Any wireframes

The original site was going to look like this.  I started building it out but wasn't totally happy with how it looked so I changed the design.

# 5. Style guide

 My site has a very simple colour scheme.

# 6. Personal Logo

Because the site was minimally designed no design logo was used.  However I made a couple of mock-up logos to meet the documentation criteria.
